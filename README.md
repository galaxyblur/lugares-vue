# Lugares - Find Capoeira
https://www.findcapoeira.com/

## About
Lugares is a free tool anyone can use to find online listings of capoeira schools and groups all over the world. The data is collected city-by-city and is updated periodically.

One purpose of this tool is to show the strength of a capoeira group's online presence & searchability -- this is reflected by the score.

The data is currently collected from the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/). That means that the data reflects Google search results for the keyword "capoeira" and does not mean that each place actually practices capoeira.

Lugares was created and is maintained by [Capoeira Online](https://www.capoeiraonline.net/).
